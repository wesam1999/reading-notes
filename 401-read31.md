## What Is AWS Amplify
Today, most companies have moved to a cloud-based model and are prepared to take the chance.<br />
Among the numerous cloud adoption services available, Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform — takes the lead around the globe.<br />
Amazon’s ever-expanding portfolio now includes over 90 services and products designed to help developers create fast, reliable, serverless,<br />
and safe web and mobile applications.<br />

Among many great services from Amazon Web Services, AWS Amplify is one such service that is gaining traction and has greatly simplified and accelerated developer tasks.<br />
This article will dive deeper into all the AWS Amplifying features, integrations, pricing models, upsides, and downsides.<br />

**All about AWS Amplify**
AWS is a full-stack platform designed to assist web and mobile developers in developing full-stack and scalable applications that are hosted by AWS. <br />
The platform includes a plethora of tools and services that enable users to easily configure backends, connect apps, deploy static web apps instantly, <br />
and manage content outside of the AWS console.<br />

AWS Amplify, which was launched in 2017, is a full-suite package of tools and services designed to help developers easily create and launch apps. <br />
It may also include code libraries, ready-to-use components, and a built-in command-line interface (CLI).<br />
The most significant advantage of this tool is that it allows you to quickly and securely integrate a wide range of functions ranging from API to AI.<br />

Likewise, the user experience is another reason for the launch of AWS Amplify.<br />
The most important aspect that must be considered when developing any application is user experience. <br />
AWS Amplify was designed to unify the user experience across multiple platforms, including web and mobile.<br />

It gives users the freedom to build on the platform with which they are most comfortable, which is especially useful for front-end development.<br />
Most Amplify users also claim that its scalability factor makes full-stack development much more comfortable.<br />

Now, let’s get familiar with the working mechanism of AWS Amplify.<br />

**How does AWS Amplify Work?**
Here, considering AWS Amplify to be a JavaScript library that allows you to create and deploy serverless applications in the cloud.<br />
It is a full-stack application platform with both client-side and server-side code.<br /> 
In a nutshell, AWS Amplify is made up of three major parts:<br />
<br />
1. Libraries<br />
<br />
2. User Interface (UI)<br />
<br />
3. Command Line Interface (CLI) Toolchain<br />
<br />
Now, all of these elements work together to manage the application development lifecycle. Here’s a quick rundown of each component:<br />
<br />
1. Libraries<br />
<br />
Using AWS Amplify, you can add, integrate and interact with AWS cloud services through this component. The library also facilitates safe authentication, storage of files, <br />
data stocking, serverless APIs, analytics, push notifications, AR/VR, and multiple other applications’ features.<br />

2. User Interface (UI)<br />

Here, in AWS Amplify, the pre-built UI components, including the authentication-requirement component, are developed around cloud workflows in your application.<br />

3. Command Line Interface (CLI) Toolchain<br />

The component Command Line Interface (CLI) Toolchain helps your application to be scaled. Also,<br />
if you ever need to add additional cloud services and functions, CLI commands can change your AWS-managed backends efficiently.<br />

Now, let us find out the main advantages of AWS Amplify in the next section.<br />

You must also face other disadvantages of managed services.<br />

3. Traffic Distribution<br />

When using AWS Amplify, you cannot distribute load balancers.<br />
In some cases, it may be a major drawback, such as the management of traffic spikes and latency problems.<br />

4. Higher Learning Curve<br />

You might know that the time you spare written code is spent on learning the platform when you are a new-born AWS Amplify. <br />
Sometimes it is rather difficult for beginners to find the right documentation method, and the various methods and versions can sometimes make navigation difficult.<br />

**How does Amplify integrate with other AWS Services?**
For cloud-connected workflows, CLI toolchain, and code libraries, AWS Amplify provides user interface elements.<br />
These libraries can be used mutually or independently to integrate with other AWS services without adjusting the existing application’s UI.<br />
You can add a couple of code lines to the combination of an existing front-end application with Amplify in simple terms.<br />

When combining an actual front-end application with AWS Amplify, few approaches, such as a complete regeneration of resources,<br />
can be done using the amplify toolchain.<br />
