## Primitives vs. Objects
### Java Type System
have two java type first one primitives and objects<br />
primitives like Int ,log ,string ,boolan <br />
objects like single value of the corresponding primitive type(we can not change it or inherit from them)<br />
###  Pros and Cons
The decision what object is to be used is based on what application performance we try to achieve.<br />
###  Single Item Memory Footprint

#### in primitives
boolean – 1 bit<br />
byte – 8 bits<br />
short, char – 16 bits<br />
int, float – 32 bits<br />
long, double – 64 bits<br />
#### in objects
Boolean – 128 bits<br />
Byte – 128 bits<br />
Short, Character – 128 bits<br />
Integer, Float – 128 bits<br />
Long, Double – 192 bits<br />
###  Memory Footprint for Arrays

Surprisingly, arrays of the primitive types long and double consume more memory than their wrapper classes Long and Double.<br />
### Default Values
Default values of the primitive types are 0 numeric types<br />
false for the boolean type.<br />
For the wrapper classes, the default value is null.<br />
### Usage
As we've seen, the primitive types are much faster and require much less memory. Therefore, we might want to prefer using them.<br />
## Exceptions
An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.<br />
### The Catch or Specify Requirement
1) try statement : the try statement catches the exception with an appropriate exception handler.<br />

2) throws statement : A method that specifies it can throw a exception must specify the throws clause in the method signature.<br />

Any exception handling code in Java that fails to honor the catch or specify requirement when dealing with checked exceptions will not compile. If an exception is an unchecked exception, then it is not required to implement the catch or specify requirement. Checked and unchecked exceptions are better explained below.<br />

### How to Throw Exceptions

Throwing an exception is as simple as using the "throw" statement. You then specify the Exception object you wish to throw. Every Exception includes a message which is a human-readable error description<br />

### The try-with-resources Statement

a try statement that declares one or more resources. <br />
note: The resource is as an object that must be closed after finishing the program. <br />

### Unchecked Exceptions — The Controversy
 controversy arises from programmers using unchecked exceptions (extending from RuntimeException)<br />
note: when they should be using checked exceptions: as a shorcut not to be bothered by the compiler. to make their signatures look simpler.<br />

### Advantages of Exceptions
first one is :**Separating Error Handling Code from "Regular" Code.**

sconed one is :**Propagating Errors Up the Call Stack.**

thired one is :**Grouping Error Types and Error Differentiation.**

## Scanning
The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.<br />

To use the Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation.<br />
