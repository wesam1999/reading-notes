## Review: High-level HTTP
Differently than with other web languages, like for instance PHP that runs as a module in Apache, Node.<br />
js comes with a web server built in.<br />
So Express is actually a hypertext transfer protocol, in short HTTP server.<br />
As such I think it doesn’t harm if we quickly cover how HTTP actually works.<br />
HTTP is a quite simple text-based protocol.<br />
I use Telnet to show what’s going on behind the scenes when you request a file in the browser. <br />
Don’t be intimidated by what you see on the screen right now.<br />

I’ll break it down for you. First I connect to the server, in this case Google.com on port 80.That’s the standard HTTP port. If the request should be encrypted, you would<br /> use port 443,which you know as HTTPS in your browser. Your browser knows this and selects the right portdepending on if you use HTTP or HTTPS. My local system will now make a call to the domain name service, which resolves the domain name to an IP address. Once it knows it, it will try to connect to this IP address on port 80,<br /> and the system will hopefully reply that we are now connected.<br />

Now the actual HTTP protocol starts. I type GET /, which means give me the index page of this web server. The web server will first tell me if the request went through <br />successfully. It communicates this by HTTP status code, in this case 200, which means okay. Then the server replies with a bunch of headers that instruct the browser to<br />do specific things, like setting a cookie and the html, which is quite a lot when it comes to Google.<br />
The command GET as we used it here is a so called HTTP verb. It is usually used to retrieve data. The other word that is used often in browsers is POST. It is used to send<br /> the data with a request like when you submit a form. And there are a few other verbs that are not used when you browse the web, but are relevant when you work <br />with so called REST APIs. These are application programming interfaces that use regular HTTP and its verbs to programmatically communicate between systems.<br />

In this course, as we are creating a regular website, GET and POST are important because we will later create routes for it. What are routes? You see that we have a path here on every HTTP verb. A path is a part of the unique resource locator or URL. That is everything in the browser address bar including: protocol, domain name, path, and query string. In my Google example this was the route path, which is identified by a slash.
## Java HTTP Request example
### HttpURLConnection

First of all, do we capitalize acronyms in class names or not? Make your mind up. Anyway, close your eyes and center yourself in 1997. Titanic was rocking the box office and inspiring a thousand memes, Spice Girls had a best-selling album, but the biggest news of the year was surely HttpURLConnection being added to Java 1.1. Here’s how you would use it to make a GET request to get the APOD data:
```
// Create a neat value object to hold the URL
URL url = new URL("https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY");

// Open a connection(?) on the URL(??) and cast the response(???)
HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();

// Now it's "open", we can set the request method, headers etc.
connection.setRequestProperty("accept", "application/json");

// This line makes the request
InputStream responseStream = connection.getInputStream();

// Manually converting the response body InputStream to APOD using Jackson
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
APOD apod = mapper.readValue(responseStream, APOD.class);

// Finally we have the response
System.out.println(apod.title);



```
