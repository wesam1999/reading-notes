 **Android Programming Languages**

In Android, basically, programming is done in two languages JAVA or C++ and XML(Extension Markup Language). Nowadays KOTLIN is also preferred. The XML file deals with the design, presentation, layouts, blueprint, etc (as a front-end) while the JAVA or KOTLIN deals with the working of buttons, variables, storing, etc (as a back-end).

Activities:An activity is the single screen in android. It is like window or frame of Java. By the help of activity, you can place all your UI components or widgets in a single screen. The 7 lifecycle method of Activity describes how activity will behave at different states.br />

Services:A Service is an application component that can perform long-running operations in the background. It does not provide a user interface. Once started, a service might continue running for some time, even after the user switches to another application.br />

Broadcast receivers:br />

A broadcast receiver (receiver) is an Android component which allows you to register for system or application events. All registered receivers for an event are notified by the Android runtime once this event happens.br />

example:<br />
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(creating / registering broadcast receivers) ----------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. static receivers
        . "registered to an event in manifest file" 
        . android oreo background execution limitations applied
        . # "use"   if our application is close it will work
    
    2. dynamic receivers
        . "registered to an event in java code"
        . no limitations applied
        . # "use"   temporary need , few event

        (static broadcast receivers) ----------------------------------------
                1. registered for an event in application manifest file
                2. event in any system action string

                    "<receiver android:name=".my broadcast receiver">
                        <intent-filter>
                            <action android:name=
  										"android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE"/>
                        </intent-filter>
                    </receiver>"

        (dynamic broadcast receiver) ---------------------------------------
                1. lives as long as the creating component is not destroyed

                . Register the receiver
                    - registerReceiver()
                    - generally in onResume()

                . unregister the receiver
                    - unregisterReceiver()
                    - generally in onPause()

                2. if you forget to unregister the receiver it 
                    throw "Leaked intent receiver" error

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Explicit VS implicit broadcasts) ---------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
        (Explicit ) -----------------------------------------------------
                1. just like Explicit intent
                2. target a specific broadcast receiver , not all receiver
                3. only the target receiver receives the broadcast

        (implicit ) -------------------------------------------------------
                1. just like implicit intent
                2. does not target the specific broadcast receiver
                3. instead defines an action
                4. all the receiver with the same action receives broadcast
                5. limitations from android oreo

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(oreo limitations) ----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    (Explicit / dynamic) ----------------------------------------------------
        1. "no limitations"
    
    (implicit / static) ----------------------------------------------------
        1. "app can not receive broadcast in their manifest 
            only receiver when dynamic registered"
```


Content providers:A content provider manages access to a central repository of data. A provider is part of an Android application, which often provides its own UI for working with the data. However, content providers are primarily intended to be used by other applications, which access the provider using a provider client object<br />
