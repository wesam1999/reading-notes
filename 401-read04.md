## Java OO Tutorial
### What Is an Object?
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object <br />
### What Is a Class?
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.<br />
## Java Classes 
Java is an object-oriented programming language.<br />

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods.<br />

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.<br />

example:<br />
````
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
````
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
### Decimals
a number whose whole number part and the fractional part is separated by a decimal point.<br />
The dot in a decimal number is called a decimal point.<br />
The digits following the decimal point show a value smaller than one.<br />
### Binary
is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).<br />
### Hexadecimal
 is the name of the numbering system that is base 16. This system, therefore, has numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.<br />
 That means that two-digit decimal numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 must be represented by a single numeral to exist in this numbering system.<br />
