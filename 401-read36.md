## Amplify and Cognito 
**Cognito**
Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile apps.<br />
Amazon Cognito has two main components: user pools and identity pools. User pools are user directories that provide sign up and sign in options for app users.<br />
Identity pools on the other hand help grant users access to other AWS services. Identity pools and user pools can be used separately or together.<br />

**Amplify**
AWS Amplify helps build secure and scalable mobile and web applications. <br />
Amplify simplifies the process of authenticating users, securely storing data and user metadata, authorizing selective access to data,<br />
integrating machine learning, analyzing application metrics, and executing server-side code.<br />

Using Amplify with Cognito is efficient because we can delegate tasks such as token refreshing and authentication to Amplify.<br />
Amplify also offers a CLI that automatically configures your project <br />
(for Yarn users who are encountering problems with dependencies, take a look at this issue: https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/2746)<br />

**Amplify provides multiple packages **
(aws-amplify-react / @aws-amplify/ui-react) which include built-in components for authentication (simple components, higher-order components a.k.a. HOCs, etc.).<br />
Amplify also allows customization of fields and appearance.<br />

Note: If you are using custom signUpFields to customize the username field,<br />
then you need to make sure that either the label of that field is the same value you set in usernameAttributes or the key of the field is username.<br />

How to Implement Amplify and Cognito without the Amplify CLI<br /><br />
Create a user pool and an identity pool on AWS Cognito<br />

**Create an App client**
While creating the App client, make sure the “Generate client secret” box is unchecked. JavaScript SDK doesn’t support apps that have a client secret.<br />

Create a .env file based on example.env with the correct IDs <br />
```
# Amplify Auth config
REACT_APP_IDENTITY_POOL_ID=""
REACT_APP_REGION=""
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID=""
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_WEBCLIENT_ID=""
REACT_APP_API=""
```
The variables mentioned above are used inside an AmplifyConfig object in shared/amplify.config.ts<br />

The Amplify configuration is based on the instructions mentioned in the following guide: https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/authentication#manual-setup<br />

 ```
export const amplifyConfig: AmplifyConfig = {
Auth: {
identityPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_IDENTITY_POOL_ID,
region: process.env.REACT_APP_REGION,
userPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID,
userPoolWebClientId: process.env.REACT_APP_USER_POOL_WEBCLIENT_ID,
},
language: "us",
};
```
We created a singleton class extending the Amplify class. This class contains an init() method that takes an AmplifyConfig object as a parameter.<br />

This AmplifyConfig is passed to the static configure() method of Amplify that initializes our app with our configuration file.<br />

You can customize the configuration file inside src/shared/amplify.config.ts<br />

We just have to call Config.getInstance().init() at the root of the project (src/index.tsx).<br />

Amplify will handle the register/login process based on our signUpFields configuration (in shared/amplify.config.ts) <br />
and display the wrapped components if the authState changes to signedIn.<br />

Depending on your configuration you can add more services (S3 for example).<br />
Amplify will apply these settings and will use your identity pool to grant you access to these Amazon services.<br />

Authentication Flow Visuals<br />

**UI Customization**
![](https://trackit.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/UI-Customization.png)<br />
To customize the components and reuse the render logic along with the built-in methods, <br />
we need to extend the original components provided by Amplify using React inheritance.<br />

![](https://trackit.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Original-components-768x364.png)<br />
Original components<br />

Here’s an example of how you can customize your UI’s logo using React inheritance.<br />

To add your logo, you need to display a logo on the Auth components. Often, this logo comes from a URL and thus you need to have a logoUrl property of type string.<br />
Since you cannot add new properties, you have to pass a component as a child of our component as a workaround.<br />

example:<br />
Confirm Sign up<br />
```
import React from "react";
import Plot from "react-plotly.js";
class Graph extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: [{
        values: [19, 26, 55],
        labels: ['Residential', 'Non-Residential', 'Utility'],
        type: 'pie'
      }],
      layout: {
        height: 400,
        width: 500,
        title: "Pie chart"
      }
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ width: "100%", height: "100%" }}>
        <Plot
          data={this.state.data}
          layout={this.state.layout}
          onInitialized={(figure) => this.setState(figure)}
          onUpdate={(figure) => this.setState(figure)}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default Graph;

```
Login<br />

For Login, we will use the SignIn method which returns the tokens and user details to us. <br />
We store those tokens in our local storage. And redirect to the home page.<br />
```
import React from "react";
import Plot from "react-plotly.js";
class Graph extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: [
        {
          x: [1, 2, 3, 4],
          y: [0, 2, 3, 5],
          fill: 'tozeroy',
          type: 'scatter',
          name: 'Vendor'
        },
        {
          x: [1, 2, 3, 4],
          y: [3, 5, 1, 7],
          fill: 'tonexty',
          type: 'scatter',
          name: 'Provider'
        }],
      layout: {
        height: 400,
        width: 600,
        title: "Area chart"
      }
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ width: "100%", height: "100%" }}>
        <Plot
          data={this.state.data}
          layout={this.state.layout}
          onInitialized={(figure) => this.setState(figure)}
          onUpdate={(figure) => this.setState(figure)}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default Graph;
```
