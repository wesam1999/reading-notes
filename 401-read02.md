## array
array:Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.<br />
example:<br />
array of index how it is work.<br />

## loops
### overviiew
**n this article, we'll look at a core aspect of the Java language – executing a statement or a group of statements repeatedly – using loops.**
### Intro to Loops
 **looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.**
 ### For Loop
 A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.<br />

 ### While Loop
 **The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.**

 ### Do-While Loop
**The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.**

## imports
### Types Of Java Package
Built-in Package: math, util, lang, i/o etc are the example of built-in packages.<br />
User-defined-package: Java package created by user to categorize their project's classes and interface are known as user-defined packages.<br />
### How to Create a Package
```
package mypack;
public class employee 
{
    String empId;
    String name; 
}


```
### Additional points about package:
Package statement must be first statement in the program even before the import statement.<br />
A package is always defined as a separate folder having the same name as the package name.<br />
Store all the classes in that package folder.<br />
All classes of the package which we wish to access outside the package must be declared public.<br />
All classes within the package must have the package statement as its first line.<br />
All classes of the package must be compiled before use.<br />
