## Rule of Three
### “Three strikes and you refactor” — Nicolas Carlo
Accept small duplication. It’s not that bad. The wrong abstraction is even worse than duplication.<br />
### When reusing code, copy it once, and only abstract the third time. — The Rule of Three
The cost of not waiting is a bad abstraction. You don’ have enough generics to extract. Two use cases are not enough. <br />
You need more than two, then you can make abstractions.<br />
### The fastest way forward is back — Sandi Metz
Don’t maintain bad abstractions. Re-do everything. Put back the code in the clients.<br />
You’ll see the duplication is not “so duplicated”, it is different after all.<br />
We as developers, don’t like to remove code. We’re born with that feeling. We suffer from sunk cost fallacy.<br />
Lost time, developers’ ego, other dumb thoughts holding us from change. We need to cut losses when necessary.<br />
Re-introduce duplication, remove bad abstraction. It’s the point of this story.<br />
## MVP – Minimum Viable Product strategy
Not all good ideas turn out into great products.  There are quite a few products that fail in the market due to a variety of reasons.<br />
### What is an MVP?
Our objective with a Minimum Viable Product is to provide a mechanism for maximum learning about the target audience or the target market with the minimum effort.<bt />
### trategies for MVP
A survey for the likely features of the product.<br />
An email campaign to see the interest generated for the product.<br />
A website which shares videos, articles about the features and the benefits to the customers.<br />
Continuous Deployment (An Agile Practice, which can add more value to the business incrementally providing more learning).<br />
A prototype / demo version of the product featuring the critical features.<bt />
A closed beta for only very few customers.<br />
### Why do we need MVP?
We do not have endless budget to build products.<br />
We want to cut the risk of a worst case scenario.  What if the product fails after 2 years of hard work?<br />
We want to stay in the business yet not stop experimenting for potential opportunities.<br />
### Benefits of MVP
Maximum learnings from minimum efforts.<br />
Early feedback about the product.<br />
Ability to realize the true value / demand of a product more quickly.<br />
More energy into the product development as we see some real demands.<br />
### Demerits of MVP
Difficult to conceptualize the apt minimum.  There is no pre-defined rules for coming up with a minimum, it is pretty much judgemental.<br />
Need to alter the product road map according to the feedback / learning which might be possible only with teams that are Agile.<br />
## YAGNI
YAGNI is a principle behind the XP practice of "do the simplest thing that could possibly work" (DTSTTCPW).
