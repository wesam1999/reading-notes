## Intents and Intent Filters<br />
An Android Intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. <br />
  It can be used with startActivity to launch an Activity, broadcastIntent to send it to any interested BroadcastReceiver components,<br />
  and startService(Intent) or bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int) to communicate with a background Service.<br />
  note: from what i understand that Intents it type of object that is allow as to transfer from activity to another activity <br />
  and transfer data like (image and text and object ....) .<br />
  
  **Implicit**
  Using implicit Intent, component can't be specifying. <br />
  An action to be performed is declared by implicit intent.<br /><br />
  Then android operating system will filter out component which will response to the action.<br />
**Some of the general functions of intent are:**<br />

1.Start service<br />
2.Launch activity<br />
3.Display web page<br />
4.Display contact list<br />
5.Message broadcasting<br />
