## Database Relationships In Spring Data JPA
Hello everyone, in this story, I will try to show Database relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, One-to-One) with examples in Spring Data JPA.<br />
Let‚Äôs start üí™ <br />
**Introduction**
I created an example ER diagram for book database. 
I will try to explain the relations by including the scenario in this diagram in the project.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1362/1*wAT6A6Cka5vKpTrm_rFzIw.png)
In this diagram, there is a Many-to-Many relationship between books and categories. A book can have more than one category,
and a category can have more than one book. The same is true for the relationship between the book and the author.
Categories can have subcategories. These subcategories must be linked to a parent category. In this case, the One-to-Many relationship emerges.
There is also a photo table attached to the books. This table keeps the cover photos of the related book in different sizes. 
The relationship here will be One-to-One.
First we will create a Spring project using Spring Initializr. Then we will establish the database connection.
I will use PostgreSQL database in this project.
Next, we will look at these relationships in more detail by applying the diagram through the code.
I used the following versions while developing this project.

Java 11.0.11
Spring 2.5.2
PostgreSQL 13.3‚Äì2
Intellij IDEA Community 2021.1.2
**Installation**
Let‚Äôs start with creating a new Spring application with Spring Initializr.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*JsNYqKvcEKaFE32FNF4U-w.png)
We should specify project metadata and select some required dependencies. After providing required data, 
we can download our demo project by clicking generate button.
Open the project in Intellij IDEA and connect to database by adding required information to application.properties file.

**Implementation**
In this section, we will implement the previously specified ER diagram.
Let‚Äôs start with entities without creating relations. For the construction and Getter & Setter methods, we will use Lombok library.
Data annotation contains ToString, Getter, Setter, EqualsAndHashCode and RequiredArgsConstructor.

```
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name = "book")
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "book_id")
    private Long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String title;

    private Long isbn;
    private Integer totalPages;
    private Double rating;
    private Date publishedDate;
}
```
This is an example to Book entity. 
Other entities will be similar. After we created all entities and run the program, we should find these tables on our database.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/502/1*Ad26n5KONtASaLcuHLpHpw.png)
We can check the restrictions from the Column section of any table properties. For example, for the Book table, title cannot be null.

If all OK, we can start to implement relations.
**OneToOne Relation**
Relationship between Book and Photo is an example to OneToOne relation.
For that relation, we need to create a foreign key for photo_id parameter in Book table.
OneToOne annotation will create this relation for us.
We should add this annotation to both entity classes that‚Äôs because this is a bidirectional relationship.
We want to create a column in Book table. So, we will use JoinColumn annotation in Book class.
On the Photo class, simply put OneToOne annotation and fill mappedBy field by variable name on the owning side. In this example, this value will be ‚Äòphoto‚Äô.

```
...
@Entity
public class Book {

    ...

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "photo_id")
    private Photo photo;
}


...
@Entity
public class Photo {
  
    ...

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "photo")
    private Book book;
}
```
Rerun the program and you will see the photo_id in columns and the foreign key in the properties of the Book table.

**OneToMany Relation**
Relationship between parent category and children categories in Category table is an example to OneToMany relation.
In this case, both parent and children tables are same, we will add both OneToMany and ManyToOne annotations to same class.
We should join a column for parent_id.

```
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name = "category")
public class Category {
    
    ...

    @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "parent_id")
    private Category parent;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent")
    private Collection<Category> children;
}
```
After rerunning the program, we will see a foreign key for parent_id in properties of Category table.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1390/1*vmi6pP_sD2-cxp_JoZYOFA.png)
**ManyToMany Relation**
Relationship between book and category is an example to ManyToMany relation.
In this relation, we need to create a new table to handle ManyToMany relationship. 
This new table will hold foreign keys for both book_id and category_id fields. We will follow the relationship between books and categories by this table.
```
...
@Entity
public class Book {

    ...

    @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinTable(
            name = "books_categories",
            joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "book_id"),
            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "category_id")
    )
    private Collection<Category> categories;

}

...
@Entity
public class Category {
    
    ...

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "categories")
    private Collection<Book> books;

}

```
After running the code, a new table called books_categories will be exist and specified foreign keys will be shown in properties of this new table.

We need same relation for book and author. After adding that, we can test our database.
**Testing**

In pgAdmin, we can find a Generate ERD (Beta) option by right click to the our database.
The result is quite similar to our ER diagram.

## Testing with Spring Boot and @SpringBootTest
With the @SpringBootTest annotation, Spring Boot provides a convenient way to start up an application context to be used in a test.
In this tutorial, we‚Äôll discuss when to use @SpringBootTest and when to better use other tools for testing.
We‚Äôll also look into different ways to customize the application context and how to reduce test runtime.
**The ‚ÄúTesting with Spring Boot‚Äù Series**
This tutorial is part of a series:

Unit Testing with Spring Boot
Testing Spring MVC Web Controllers with Spring Boot and @WebMvcTest
Testing JPA Queries with Spring Boot and @DataJpaTest
Testing with Spring Boot and @SpringBootTest
If you like learning from videos, make sure to check out Philip‚Äôs Testing Spring Boot Applications Masterclass (if you buy through this link, I get a cut).
**Integration Tests vs. Unit Tests**
Before we start into integration tests with Spring Boot, let‚Äôs define what sets an integration test apart from a unit test.

A unit test covers a single ‚Äúunit‚Äù, where a unit commonly is a single class, but can also be a cluster of cohesive classes that is tested in combination.

An integration test can be any of the following:

a test that covers multiple ‚Äúunits‚Äù. It tests the interaction between two or more clusters of cohesive classes.
a test that covers multiple layers. 
This is actually a specialization of the first case and might cover the interaction between a business service and the persistence layer, for instance.
a test that covers the whole path through the application.
In these tests, we send a request to the application and check that it responds correctly and has changed the database state according to our expectations.
Spring Boot provides the @SpringBootTest annotation which we can use to create an application context containing all the objects we need for all of the above test types.
Note, however, that overusing @SpringBootTest might lead to very long-running test suites.

So, for simple tests that cover multiple units we should rather create plain tests, 
very similar to unit tests, in which we manually create the object graph needed for the test and mock away the rest. This way,
Spring doesn‚Äôt fire up a whole application context each time the test is started.

**Test Slices**

e can test our Spring Boot application as a whole, unit by unit, and also layer by layer. Using Spring Boot‚Äôs test slice annotations we can test each layer separately.

Before we look into the @SpringBootTest annotation in detail, let‚Äôs explore the test slice annotation to check if @SpringBootTest is really what you want.

The @SpringBootTest annotation loads the complete Spring application context.
In contrast, a test slice annotation only loads beans required to test a particular layer. 
And because of this, we can avoid unnecessary mocking and side effects.

**@WebMvcTest**
Our web controllers bear many responsibilities, such as listening to the HTTP request, validating the input, calling the business logic, serializing the output, 
and translating the Exceptions to a proper response. We should write tests to verify all these functionalities.

The @WebMvcTest test slice annotation will set up our application context with just enough components and configurations required to test our web controller layer. 
For instance, it will set up our @Controller‚Äôs, @ControllerAdvice‚Äôs, a MockMvc bean, and some other auto configuration.

To read more on @WebMvcTest and to find out how we can verify each of those responsibilities, read my article on Testing MVC Web Controllers with Spring Boot and @WebMvcTest.
**@WebFluxTest**
@WebFluxTest is used when we want to test our WebFlux controllers.
@WebFluxTest works similar to the @WebMvcTest annotation difference here is that instead of the Web MVC components and configurations,
it spins up the WebFlux ones. One such bean is the WebTestClient, using which we can test our WebFlux endpoints.

**@DataJpaTest**
Just like @WebMvcTest allows us to test our web layer, @DataJpaTest is used to test the persistence layer.

It configures our entities, repositories and also sets up an embedded database. Now, this is all good but, what does testing our persistence layer mean? What exactly are we testing? If queries,
then what kind of queries? To find out answers for all these questions and more, read my article on Testing JPA Queries with Spring Boot and @DataJpaTest.
**@DataJdbcTest**
Spring Data JDBC is another member of the Spring Data family. If we are using this project and want to test the persistence layer then we can make use of the @DataJdbcTest annotation. 
@DataJdbcTest automatically configures an embedded test database and JDBC repositories defined in our project for us.

Another similar project is Spring JDBC which gives us the JdbcTemplate object to perform direct queries.
The @JdbcTest annotation autoconfigures the DataSource object that is required to test our JDBC queries.
**Dependencies**
The code examples in this article only need the dependencies to Spring Boot‚Äôs test starter and to JUnit Jupiter:
```
dependencies {
	testCompile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test')
	testCompile('org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.4.0')
}
```
**Creating an ApplicationContext with @SpringBootTest**
@SpringBootTest by default starts searching in the current package of the test class and then searches upwards through the package structure,
looking for a class annotated with @SpringBootConfiguration from which it then reads the configuration to create an application context. 
This class is usually our main application class since the @SpringBootApplication annotation includes the @SpringBootConfiguration annotation. 
It then creates an application context very similar to the one that would be started in a production environment.

We can customize this application context in many different ways, as described in the next section.

Because we have a full application context, including web controllers, Spring Data repositories, 
and data sources, @SpringBootTest is very convenient for integration tests that go through all layers of the application:

```
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class RegisterUseCaseIntegrationTest {

  @Autowired
  private MockMvc mockMvc;

  @Autowired
  private ObjectMapper objectMapper;

  @Autowired
  private UserRepository userRepository;

  @Test
  void registrationWorksThroughAllLayers() throws Exception {
    UserResource user = new UserResource("Zaphod", "zaphod@galaxy.net");

    mockMvc.perform(post("/forums/{forumId}/register", 42L)
            .contentType("application/json")
            .param("sendWelcomeMail", "true")
            .content(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(user)))
            .andExpect(status().isOk());

    UserEntity userEntity = userRepository.findByName("Zaphod");
    assertThat(userEntity.getEmail()).isEqualTo("zaphod@galaxy.net");
  }

}
```
Here, we additionally use @AutoConfigureMockMvc to add a MockMvc instance to the application context.

We use this MockMvc object to perform a POST request to our application and to verify that it responds as expected.

We then use the UserRepository from the application context to verify that the request has lead to an expected change in the state of the database.
