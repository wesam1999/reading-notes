## SQL
SQL might seem intimidating but it’s really fairly easy to understand. SQL stands for
Structured Query Language and simply put, it’s a search language for you to instruct a
database about what information you’d like retrieved from it.<br />
## SELECT queries:
Select query for a specific columns<br />
SELECT column, another_column, …<br />
FROM mytable;<br />
and 
Select query for all columns
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;
slect all table for movies
SELECT * FROM movies;
## Queries with constraints
Select query with constraints
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable<br />
WHERE condition<br />
    AND/OR another_condition<br />
    AND/OR …;<br />
