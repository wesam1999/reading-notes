## Java Graph
In Java, the Graph is a data structure that stores a certain of data.<br />
The concept of the graph has been stolen from the mathematics that fulfills the need of the computer science field. <br />
It represents a network that connects multiple points to each other. In this section, we will learn Java Graph data structure in detail. <br />
Also, we will learn the types of Graph, their implementation, and traversal over the graph.<br />

**Graph**
A graph is a data structure that stores connected data.<br />
In other words, a graph G (or g) is defined as a set of vertices (V) and edges (E) that connects vertices.<br /><br />
The examples of graph are a social media network, computer network, Google Maps, etc.<br />

Each graph consists of edges and vertices (also called nodes). Each vertex and edge have a relation. <br />
Where vertex represents the data and edge represents the relation between them. Vertex is denoted by a circle with a label on them.<br />
Edges are denoted by a line that connects nodes (vertices).<br />

**Graph Terminology**
Vertex: Vertices are the point that joints edges. It represents the data. It is also known as a node.<br />
It is denoted by a circle and it must be labeled. To construct a graph there must be at least a node. For example, house, bus stop, etc.<br />
Edge: An edge is a line that connects two vertices. It represents the relation between the vertices.<br />
Edges are denoted by a line. For example, a path to the bus stop from your house.<br />

Weight: It is labeled to edge. For example, the distance between two cities is 100 km, then the distance is called weight for the edge.<br />

Path: The path is a way to reach a destination from the initial point in a sequence.<br />

**Types of Graph**
*Weighted Graph: In a weighted graph, each edge contains some data (weight) such as distance, weight, height, etc. It denoted as w(e). <br />
It is used to calculate the cost of traversing from one vertex to another. The following figure represents a weighted graph.<br />

*Unweighted Graph: A graph in which edges are not associated with any value is called an unweighted graph. The following figure represents an unweighted graph.<br />

*Directed Graph: A graph in which edges represent direction is called a directed graph. In a directed graph, we use arrows instead of lines (edges). <br />
Direction denotes the way to reach from one node to another node.<br />
Note that in a directed graph, we can move either in one direction or in both directions. The following figure represents a directed graph.<br />

*Undirected Graph: A graph in which edges are bidirectional is called an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, we can traverse in any direction.<br />
Note that we can use the same path for return through which we have traversed. While in the directed graph we cannot return from the same path.<br />

*Connected Graph: A graph is said to be connected if there exists at least one path between every pair of vertices.<br />
Note that a graph with only a vertex is a connected graph.<br />

There are two types of connected graphs.<br />
1.Weekly Connected Graph: A graph in which nodes cannot be visited by a single path is called a weekly connected graph.<br />

2.Strongly Connected Graph: A graph in which nodes can be visited by a single path is called a strongly connected graph.<br />

*Disconnected Graph: A graph is said to be disconnected if there is no path between a pair of vertices is called a disconnected graph.<br />
A disconnected graph may consist of two or more connected graphs.<br />

*Multi Graph: A graph that has multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes. The following figure represents a multi-graph.<br />

*Dense Graph: A graph in which the number of edges is close to the maximal number of edges, the graph is called the dense graph.<br />
The following figure represents a dense graph.<br />

*Sparse Graph: A graph in which the number of edges is close to the minimal number of edges, the graph is called the sparse graph.<br />
It can be a disconnected graph. The following figure represents a sparse graph.<br />

example:
```
class Graph {

  // inner class
  // to keep track of edges
  class Edge {
    int src, dest;
  }

  // number of vertices and edges
  int vertices, edges;

  // array to store all edges
  Edge[] edge;

  Graph(int vertices, int edges) {
    this.vertices = vertices;
    this.edges = edges;

    // initialize the edge array
    edge = new Edge[edges];
    for(int i = 0; i < edges; i++) {

      // each element of the edge array
      // is an object of Edge type
      edge[i] = new Edge();
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create an object of Graph class
    int noVertices = 5;
    int noEdges = 8;
    Graph g = new Graph(noVertices, noEdges);

    // create graph
    g.edge[0].src = 1;   // edge 1---2
    g.edge[0].dest = 2;

    g.edge[1].src = 1;   // edge 1---3
    g.edge[1].dest = 3;

    g.edge[2].src = 1;   // edge 1---4
    g.edge[2].dest = 4;

    g.edge[3].src = 2;   // edge 2---4
    g.edge[3].dest = 4;

    g.edge[4].src = 2;   // edge 2---5
    g.edge[4].dest = 5;

    g.edge[5].src = 3;   // edge 3---4
    g.edge[5].dest = 4;

    g.edge[6].src = 3;   // edge 3---5
    g.edge[6].dest = 5;

    g.edge[7].src = 4;   // edge 4---5
    g.edge[7].dest = 5;

    // print graph
    for(int i = 0; i < noEdges; i++) {
      System.out.println(g.edge[i].src + " - " + g.edge[i].dest);
    }

  }
}
