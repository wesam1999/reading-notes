## One-to-many and many-to-one connections using GraphQL in AWS Amplify 
If you’re just getting started with Amplify’s GraphQL then you will likely need to at some point retrieve related documents in your database.<br />
The typical example of this is to retrieve all comments of a post when you visit a post. The @connection directive does a great job of this and is easy to implement.<br />

Getting Started
First of all, decide what kind of relationship you require between your data objects. There are the following patterns available between connected objects:<br />

one-to-one,
one-to-many
many-to-one
For a many-to-many relationship, you can use two one-to-many relationships<br />
one-to-one Connections
What does one-to-one mean? This simply means that there is only one object connected to another object. For instance, one project has one team of people. <br />
So, in the database, you will have a single object representing the project and another object representing the team.<br />
Basically, you are creating a connection between two database objects only. <br />
That doesn't mean you can only have one project object — you can have many — but each project object has only one team connected to it.<br />

What does “create a connection” mean? It simply means that you don’t have to query for a connected item with a separate query.<br />
In the project example that will mean that when you query for the project, then the team object can automatically be attached to the returned project object.<br />
You don't have to know anything about the team object like its id.

Here is an example of a one-to-one connection:<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/367/1*kcLB6rG8reZxBOY39VrZxQ.png)
You can see that the team field on the Project schema object has the @connection(fields: [“teamID”]) directive attached. <br />
How does the API connect the connected team object in this case? Quite simply, the directive tells the API to connect the team object with the id that matches the project object’s teamID field.<br />

How does the API find the correct team object when it has the teamID from the project object? It queries the team table's primary index.<br />
The primary index uses the id as a hash if no @key is used on the Team schema object, or else it uses the first field that you specify with an @key that has no name field. <br />
To learn more about the @key and how it creates primary and secondary indexes, refer to my previous article here.<br />

When you query the Project object with its id, the @connection will query all the Team objects in the database using the primary index of the Team table.<br />

Importantly:

A Has One @connection can only reference the primary index of a model (ie. it cannot specify a “keyName” as described below in the Has Many section).<br />

So now to create a project and a connected team, use the following:<br />

One-to-many Connections
One-to-many connections require an index created with the @key on a connected object. <br />
In the schema below, the Comment object schema has a secondary index created with the @key called byPost . <br />
In the Post object comments field, the @connection uses this index named byPost to find comments with a matching postID .<br />

```
query QueryAllTodos {
  listTodos() {
    todos {
      items {
        id
        content
        createdAt
        updatedAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Configure a primary key
Every GraphQL type with the @model directive will automatically have an id field set as the primary key. <br />
You can override this behavior by marking another required field with the @primaryKey directive.<br />

In the example below, todoId is the database's primary key and an id field will no longer be created automatically anymore by the @model directive.<br />

You can create posts and comments separately like this:<br />

Many-to-one Connections
The next step to create a many-to-one relationship is simple.<br />
Starting with the one-to-many code, just add a Post field on the Comment schema and add an @connection on to it to link many comments back to one post.<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1*fDE0L_NXfy_2fbUpRwraHA.png)
The @connection on the post field of the Comment object schema doesn’t need a keyName key because it will find the post using the automatically <br />
created primary index of the Post schema object which has the id field as the hash.<br />

You create posts and comments like this:<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*bku5VNuWd6ce9rbBHnee0A.png)
Note that you must provide comments and post ids. You can now query the API like this:<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/359/1*F002kig-mXXvuc2m9EiLoQ.png)
Note how you can surf the @connections by getting one comment with its id, then get that comment’s post, and then get all the other comments linked with that post.<br />
So you go from many-to-one ([one of] many comments to one post), then one-to-many (one post to many comments).<br />

Many-to-many Connections<br />
Now it gets a bit complicated. This pattern uses a one-to-many pattern twice<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/553/1*HjDFFhYVkqiaPKzUj0ZCjw.png)
The trick in understanding this is that the PostEditor is the link between Post and User. First, create Posts and Users, then create PostEditors.<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/598/1*GW8UyZsbtb0ZXsAysSc8QQ.png)
Notice that the indexes created by the @keys in the PostEditor have their fields switched.<br />

Now you can query one of many users and get their posts.<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/251/1*xrvUxg53_rYBrk1Xa0Lhpg.png)
The flow of the above query @connections looks like this:<br />

## CompletableFuture in Java <br />
A CompletableFuture is an extension to Java's Future API which was introduced in Java 8. A Future is used for asynchronous Programming. <br />
It provides two methods, isDone() and get(). The methods retrieve the result of the computation when it completes.<br /><br />
CompletionStage<br />
It performs an action and returns a value when another completion stage completes.<br />
A model for a task that may trigger other tasks.<br />
Hence, it is an element of a chain.<br />
Future vs. CompletableFuture<br /><br />
A CompletableFuture is an extension to Java's Future API which was introduced in Java 8.<br />

A Future is used for asynchronous Programming. It provides two methods, isDone() and get(). The methods retrieve the result of the computation when it completes.<br /><br />

Limitations of the Future<br />
A Future cannot be mutually complete.<br />

We cannot perform further action on a Future's result without blocking.<br />
A Future cannot be mutually complete.<br />
Future has not any exception handling.<br />
We cannot combine multiple futures.<br />
Future has so many limitations, that's why we have CompletableFuture.<br />
CompletableFuture provides a broad set of methods for creating multiple Futures, chaining, and combining. It also has comprehensive exception handling support.<br />

Creating a CompletableFuture<br />
We can create a CompletableFuture only by using the following no-argument constructor.<br />
```
CompletableFuture<String> CompletableFuture = new CompletableFuture<String>();  
```
Exception Handling of CompletableFuture<br />
Consider the following figure, which represents the five CFs:<br />
![](https://static.javatpoint.com/core/images/exception-handling-of-java.png)
Suppose Five CFs in execution and CF21 raises an exception then all the depending CF (CF31 and CF41) are in error. It means that:<br />

The call to isCompletedExceptionally() method returns true.<br />
The call to get() throws an ExecutionException which causes the root Exception.<br />
Consider the following figure, in which we have created CF30 with an exception.<br />
![](https://static.javatpoint.com/core/images/exception-handling-of-java2.png)
When CF21 executes normally, then CF30 just transmits the value. If it raises an exception, CF30 handles it and generate value for CF31.<br />

There are three method to handle an exception:<br />
```
public CompletableFuture <T> exceptionally(Function <Throwable, ? extends T> function);  
public <U> CompletableFuture<U> hadle(BiFunction<? super T, Throwable, ? extends U> bifunction);  
public CompletableFuture<T> whenComplete(BiConsumer<? super T, ? super Throwable> action); 
```
