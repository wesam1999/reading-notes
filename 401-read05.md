## B(O)
and start to check out the bog (o) and type of the B(o) like O(n)and O(log n)and O(n).<br />
## databacse (linked list) 

and get next thing is databases first thing in database  it is linked list  <br />

a linked list is a class that is contained a class of nodes every node contains the value and<br />

 pointer for and has another head node that has a pointer for the first node in a linked list<br />

this is named by a singular.<br />

we have another linked list double-coated type have two-pointer for the node one for next and the other for pre node.<br />

the next step is how to print the linked list using a while loop and stop we the value is equal to null.<br />
how to print linked list pay used while loop used condition pointer!=null then print it.<br />

how to add a new node for first linked list first used while loop has condition pointer!=null and  <br />

then newNode =pionter.next ;<br />

pointer.next=newNode;<br />

we I end the while loop pionter=pionter.next;<br />

------------------------------------------------------------<br />

node newNode =new node(value);<br />

add pointer =head.next;<br />

how to add a new node for end linked list first used while loop has condition pointer!=null and  <br />

if condition pointer.next ==null  <br />

then newNode =null ;<br />

pointer.next=newNode;<br />

we I end the while loop pionter=pionter.next;<br />
