## Serving Web Content with Spring MVC
his guide walks you through the process of creating a "hello world" web site with Spring.<br />
 **What you’ll build**
 You’ll build an application that has a static home page, and also will accept HTTP GET requests at:<br />

http://localhost:8080/greeting<br />
and respond with a web page displaying HTML. The body of the HTML contains a greeting:<br />

"Hello, World!"<br />
You can customize the greeting with an optional name parameter in the query string:<br />

http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User<br />
The name parameter value overrides the default value of "World" and is reflected in the response:<br />

"Hello, User!"<br />
**What you’ll need**
About 15 minutes

A favorite text editor or IDE

JDK 1.8 or later

Gradle 4+ or Maven 3.2+

You can also import the code straight into your IDE:

Spring Tool Suite (STS)

IntelliJ IDEA

**How to complete this guide**
Like most Spring Getting Started guides, you can start from scratch and complete each step, or you can bypass basic setup steps that are already familiar to you. Either way, you end up with working code.

To start from scratch, move on to Build with Gradle.

To skip the basics, do the following:

Download and unzip the source repository for this guide, or clone it using Git: git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-serving-web-content.git

cd into gs-serving-web-content/initial

Jump ahead to Create a web controller.

When you’re finished, you can check your results against the code in gs-serving-web-content/complete.
**Build with Gradle**
First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with Gradle and Maven is included here. If you’re not familiar with either, refer to Building Java Projects with Gradle or Building Java Projects with Maven.

Create the directory structure
In a project directory of your choosing, create the following subdirectory structure; for example, with mkdir -p src/main/java/hello on *nix systems:

└── src
    └── main
        └── java
            └── hello
Create a Gradle build file
Below is the initial Gradle build file.

build.gradle
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:2.0.3.RELEASE")
    }
}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'eclipse'
apply plugin: 'idea'
apply plugin: 'org.springframework.boot'
apply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management'

bootJar {
    baseName = 'gs-serving-web-content'
    version =  '0.1.0'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

sourceCompatibility = 1.8
targetCompatibility = 1.8

dependencies {
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf")
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools")
    testCompile("junit:junit")
}

```
The Spring Boot gradle plugin provides many convenient features:

It collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single, runnable "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.

It searches for the public static void main() method to flag as a runnable class.

It provides a built-in dependency resolver that sets the version number to match Spring Boot dependencies. You can override any version
you wish, but it will default to Boot’s chosen set of versions.
**Build with Maven**
First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with Maven is included here. If you’re not familiar with Maven, refer to Building Java Projects with Maven.

In a project directory of your choosing, create the following subdirectory structure; for example, with mkdir -p src/main/java/hello on *nix systems:

        └── java
            └── hello
pom.xml
```

## How to access data in Thymeleaf templates
Thymeleaf is a popular server-side template engine for Java applications. You can easily integrate it into a Spring Boot project to develop web applications.

In a standard Spring MVC application, the controller classes are the ones that collect data from different sources like databases or RESTful APIs, and then select a view to render and return the HTML back to the user. They create a model map with data that is later converted into a Thymeleaf context object.

In this article, you'll learn how to access Spring model attributes, request parameters, session attributes, and Spring beans in Thymeleaf templates.

**Spring Model Attributes**
Spring model attributes are useful for transferring data from Spring controllers to Thymeleaf views. In Thymeleaf terminology, they are called context variables.

There are several ways to add model attributes to a view in Spring MVC. The simplest way is to use the Model's addAttribute() method:

```
@GetMapping("/todos")
public String todoList(Model model) {

    List<Todo> todos = Arrays.asList(
            new Todo(1, "Buy milk"),
            new Todo(2, "Prepare Java talk"),
            new Todo(3, "Go for a walk")
    );

    // add model attribute
    model.addAttribute("todos", todos);

    return "index";
}
```
Alternatively, you could also return a ModelAndView object with model attributes included:
```
@GetMapping("/todos")
public ModelAndView todoList() {

    List<Todo> todos = Arrays.asList(
            new Todo(1, "Buy milk"),
            new Todo(2, "Prepare presentation"),
            new Todo(3, "Write tutorial")
    );

    // create a new `ModelAndView` object
    ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("index");
    mav.addObject("todos", todos);

    return mav;
}
```
You can also use the @ModelAttribute annotation to expose common model attributes:
```
@ModelAttribute
public List<Todo> todos() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            new Todo(1, "Buy milk"),
            new Todo(2, "Prepare presentation"),
            new Todo(3, "Write tutorial")
    );
}
```
**Request Parameters**
Request parameters (also called query string parameters) are passed from the client to the server as part of the URL:
```
https://google.com/search?q=thymeleaf&lang=en&num=15
```
To access query string parameters in a Thymeleaf template, you can use the param prefix as shown below:
```
<div th:text="${param.q}">search query</div>
<div th:text="${param.lang}">language</div>
<div th:text="${param.num}">results per page</div>
```
**Session Attributes**
Spring MVC uses the HttpSession class for the session management and storing any temporary information:
```
@GetMapping("/signup")
public String signup(HttpSession session) {

    // store data in session
    session.setAttribute("email", "john.doe@example.com");

    return "signup";
}
```
**Spring Beans**
Thymeleaf allows us to access beans registered at the Spring Application Context by using the @beanName syntax.

Let us create a simple Spring bean and register it with the Application Context:
```
@Configuration
public class ThymeleafConfig {
    @Bean(name = "googleSearch")
    public GoogleSearch googleSearch() {
        return (q) -> "https://google.com/search?q=" + q;
    }
}

public interface GoogleSearch {
  String buildUrl(String q);
}
```
