**Hibernate many to many mapping **is made between two entities where one can have relation with multiple other entity instances.<br />
For example, for a subscription service SubscriptionEntity and ReaderEntity can be two type of entities. <br />
Any subscription can have multiple readers, where a reader can subscribe to multiple subscriptions.<br />

In this hibernate tutorial, we will learn to create many to many mapping in database using hibernate.<br />

**Hibernate many to many mapping design**

To demonstrate many to many mapping using hibernate annotations, we will associate two entities i.e. ReaderEntity and SubscriptionEntity.<br />

Their database schema should look like this. Using these tables, any application can save multiple associations between readers and subscriptions.<br />

** Owner entity**
Owner entity is the entity which is responsible make making the association and maintaining it.<br />
In our case, I am making ReaderEntity the owner entity. @JoinTable annotation has been used to make this association.<br />
```
ReaderEntity.java
package hibernate.test.manyToMany.joinTable;
 
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Set;
 
import javax.persistence.CascadeType;
import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.JoinColumn;
import javax.persistence.JoinTable;
import javax.persistence.ManyToMany;
import javax.persistence.Table;
import javax.persistence.UniqueConstraint;
 
@Entity(name = "ReaderEntity")
@Table(name = "READER", uniqueConstraints = {
    @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = "ID"),
    @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = "EMAIL") })
 
public class ReaderEntity implements Serializable 
{
  private static final long serialVersionUID = -1798070786993154676L;
 
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  @Column(name = "ID", unique = true, nullable = false)
  private Integer readerId;
 
  @Column(name = "EMAIL", unique = true, nullable = false, length = 100)
  private String email;
 
  @Column(name = "FIRST_NAME", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
  private String firstName;
 
  @Column(name = "LAST_NAME", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
  private String lastName;
 
  @ManyToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
  @JoinTable(name="READER_SUBSCRIPTIONS", joinColumns={@JoinColumn(referencedColumnName="ID")}
                    , inverseJoinColumns={@JoinColumn(referencedColumnName="ID")})  
  private Set<SubscriptionEntity> subscriptions;
 
  //Getters and setters
}
```
**Mapped entity**
Our mapped entity is SubscriptionEntity which is mapped to ReaderEntity using “mappedBy” attribute.<br />

```
SubscriptionEntity.java
package hibernate.test.manyToMany.joinTable;
 
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Set;
 
import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.ManyToMany;
import javax.persistence.Table;
import javax.persistence.UniqueConstraint;
 
@Entity(name = "SubscriptionEntity")
@Table(name = "SUBSCRIPTION", uniqueConstraints = {
    @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = "ID")})
 
public class SubscriptionEntity implements Serializable 
{
  private static final long serialVersionUID = -6790693372846798580L;
 
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  @Column(name = "ID", unique = true, nullable = false)
  private Integer subscriptionId;
 
  @Column(name = "SUBS_NAME", unique = true, nullable = false, length = 100)
  private String subscriptionName;
   
  @ManyToMany(mappedBy="subscriptions")
  private Set<ReaderEntity> readers;
 
  //Getters and setters
}
```
**Configuring entities in hibernate config file**
We have make available both entities to runtime. To do so, we have to add them in hibernate.cfg.xml file.<br />

```
hibernate.cfg.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC
"-//Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration DTD 3.0//EN"
"http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hibernatetest</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.password">XXXXXX</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.username">root</property>
        <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect</property>
        <property name="show_sql">true</property>
    <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>
        <mapping class="hibernate.test.manyToMany.joinTable.ReaderEntity"/>
        <mapping class="hibernate.test.manyToMany.joinTable.SubscriptionEntity"/>
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
```
**Hibernate many to many annotation mapping example**
Now, its time to test the code. I have written following code to test above entities and their many to many relationship.<br />

```
TestJoinTable.java
package hibernate.test.manyToMany;
 
import hibernate.test.HibernateUtil;
import hibernate.test.manyToMany.joinTable.*;
 
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;
 
import org.hibernate.Session;
 
public class TestJoinTable
{
  public static void main(String[] args) 
  {
    Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
    session.beginTransaction();
        
    //Add subscription
    SubscriptionEntity subOne = new SubscriptionEntity();
    subOne.setSubscriptionName("Entertainment");
     
    SubscriptionEntity subTwo = new SubscriptionEntity();
    subTwo.setSubscriptionName("Horror");
     
    Set<SubscriptionEntity> subs = new HashSet<SubscriptionEntity>();
    subs.add(subOne);
    subs.add(subTwo);
     
    //Add readers
    ReaderEntity readerOne = new ReaderEntity();
    readerOne.setEmail("demo-user1@mail.com");
    readerOne.setFirstName("demo");
    readerOne.setLastName("user");
     
    ReaderEntity readerTwo = new ReaderEntity();
    readerTwo.setEmail("demo-user2@mail.com");
    readerTwo.setFirstName("demo");
    readerTwo.setLastName("user");
     
    Set<ReaderEntity> readers = new HashSet<ReaderEntity>();
    readers.add(readerOne);
    readers.add(readerTwo);
     
    readerOne.setSubscriptions(subs);
    readerTwo.setSubscriptions(subs);
 
    session.save(readerOne);
    session.save(readerTwo);
     
    session.getTransaction().commit();
    HibernateUtil.shutdown();
  }
}
```
Program Output:<br />
```

In this article, we will take a bird's eye view of Spring Security to understand what it is used for and what it has to offer us. Anything on the web is a potential victim of an attack. Unfortunately, securing a web application and implementing features like authorization and authentication are no walk in the park in a world where even the richest, most innovative technology companies get hacked. So when our boss gives us a task to secure the application, should we sit and wait, scared, not knowing what to do? Of course not.

Whether or not you are going to use Auth0 to secure your Spring app, you will need to know the basics of Spring Security to secure your application rapidly, and this makes it a must-know framework for any Spring developer. The thing with Spring Security is: It is difficult. Not because it is poorly designed or could be easier to use, but because of the complexity of its domain: Application security. Complex problems require technically sophisticated solutions, and security is one of them.

If you have ever taken a glance at a Spring Security-related documentation or tutorial, you might be scared of how complicated it looks. 
I mean, take a look at this picture from Wikipedia:

It is very natural to feel overwhelmed, especially if you are also new to Spring. Spring Security is a huge framework, but once you get the basics down, you can easily get the task of securing your app done by integrating it with an IDaaS service like Auth0 without the hassle of implementing everything yourself.
**Why Spring?**
Spring is the most popular Java framework for developing web services. Whether it is an enterprise project or a startup, Spring has all the tools to help you develop rapidly and focus on your application logic.

Very reliable and mature platform (around since 2003) with a huge ecosystem. This means there are plenty of ready-to-use libraries and projects to make your life easier.
Used extensively by almost every big name in techs such as Amazon, Google, and Netflix.
It is fast & multithreaded (unlike Node.js), therefore great for CPU-intensive tasks such as video encoding, image manipulation, financial calculations.
Lets you focus on the business logic with very minimal configuration via the help of Spring Boot.
Supports Kotlin.
JPA generates most of the basic queries for you. Only for the special cases, it is useful to write a query by yourself.
Easy to develop Microservices with an embedded web server and Spring Cloud.
Secure. Spring is commonly used for banking and other security-critical applications, partially due to Spring Security.
**What is Spring Security?**
Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing authentication and authorization mechanisms to Spring applications. It was started in 2003 as an open-source project under the name of "Acegi Security" before officially being included in Spring Projects. In addition to authentication and authorization, Spring Security can be configured to protect your application against many common attacks, including but not limited to CSRF, XSS, Brute Forcing, and MITM (Man in the Middle), if you want to learn more about these attacks, you can take a look into this article by Holly Lloyd.
**Why Spring Security?**
One of the best things you can do if you don't have experience in securing an application is to find out if the language/platform you are using has a security framework. By using a security framework that can be relied on, we are delegating the responsibility of determining the architecture & implementing the core security features to a team of experts in this field who work on that particular framework. If you are building a Spring application, Spring Security is a reliable, extensively tested, and open-source security framework, and it is probably one of the most reliable security frameworks among every language and platform.

Why Spring Security?
One of the best things you can do if you don't have experience in securing an application is to find out if the language/platform you are using has a security framework. By using a security framework that can be relied on, we are delegating the responsibility of determining the architecture & implementing the core security features to a team of experts in this field who work on that particular framework. If you are building a Spring application, Spring Security is a reliable, extensively tested, and open-source security framework, and it is probably one of the most reliable security frameworks among every language and platform.

**Features**
In this section, we are going to direct our attention to the features that Spring Security has and what it can provide us or its use-cases. We are also briefly mentioning the "how" while doing so


**Session Management**
In the applications where backend and frontend are tightly coupled, like Spring MVC applications or any other MVC framework: Whenever a user logs in, a session is stored in the server that holds information about this user. Operations like retrieving, caching, destroying this session are called Session Management. Spring Security provides mechanisms to control this session object. It will create the session when a user logs in, destroy it when they log out and allow us to set the timeout value.

Spring Security also takes additional measures to make sure the sessions are being utilized in a secure way:

It is configurable to disable using URL rewriting to avoid the Session Tracking attack.
It automatically migrates the session when the user logs in again to avoid Session Fixation.
It allows us to use httpOnly and secure flags on session cookies to protect our cookies.
Remember Me Authentication
Remember Me authentication is the mechanism to recognize the user after their session times out, so the users do not need to enter their credentials every time they visit the website. Spring Security supports multiple ways to implement this type of authentication.

The typical way to implement Remember Me authentication is by hashing the user details with a secret key that is on the server and encoding it along with the username and expiration time.
```
   base64(username + ":" + expirationTime + ":" +
             md5Hex(username + ":" + expirationTime + ":" password + ":" + key))

    username:          As identifiable to the UserDetailsService
    password:          That matches the one in the retrieved UserDetails
    expirationTime:    The date and time when the remember-me token expires,
                       expressed in milliseconds
    key:               A private key to prevent modification of the remember-me token
```
Though it works, this approach has some flaws. If an attacker captures the cookie somehow, it will work by anyone from any source until it expires. The only way for the users to invalidate their tokens is to change their passwords.

A better approach for implementing Remember Me authentication is storing a persistent token in the database instead of the Remember Me cookie. The token is stored in a similar way to a session object, but the difference is that it is saved to a database instead of temporary application memory.

**API Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
We have mentioned that server-side sessions can be used to confirm the identity of a user and to keep track of their roles (what they are allowed to do). Since the REST is a sessionless protocol, it is advised not to store a session in RESTful APIs. We can instead make use of another popular approach to check if a user is authorized to take some action.

In applications that use JWT, after a user completes a successful login, an access token is generated with a secret key on the server, which usually contains information about the user's identity and token's generation timestamp. In separated frontend-backend architectures, the frontend stores this token in cookies.

It is possible to implement JWT Authorization for your application by making use of Auth0 JWT library for encoding/decoding the tokens. In addition to this, Spring Security may be used for filtering the requests and checking for the user's roles, only allowing the authorized users to pass through the filters.

**OAuth 2.0**
Open Authorization 2.0 is an open standard for checking a user's permissions on service with the help of an authorization server. It is not uncommon to use OpenID Connect to confirm the user's identity, and OAuth can then provide a token that contains the list of permissions for this user. After the user receives the OAuth 2 access token, they will use it to access the protected resources on the server. OAuth is a very popular standard, and it is also used to implement features such as Facebook login or Google account login, so even if you do not know what it is consciously, you probably used it before without knowing.

Setting up an authorization server and implementing OAuth and OpenID Connect comes with its own risks and can be time-consuming. It is easy to mess up and create a vulnerability by mistake.

Instead of trying to build everything from scratch, it is a good idea to integrate Spring Security with Auth0 and spend your precious time on improving the business logic instead.
