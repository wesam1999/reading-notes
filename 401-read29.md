## Save data in a local database using Room 
Almost every application we use stores data for one purpose or another, be it to store images, files, user preferences, etc.<br />
One of the most common use cases is to cache relevant pieces of data so that when the device cannot access the network, the user can still browse that content while they are offline.
Android is full of ways to store data, depending on our use case.<br />
In this article, I will be talking about the best-recommended way to store structured data, and that is the Room library.<br />

The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.<br />

Why should we be using Room over SQLite?<br />
No runtime queries errors, as Room provides compile-time verification of SQL queries.<br />
Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.<br />
It integrates seamlessly with the other architecture components.<br />
Primary Components<br />
1.Entity<br />
2.DAO<br />
3.Database<br />
**Entity**
Represents tables in your app’s database. <br />
Room creates a table for each class that has an @Entity annotation, the fields in the class correspond to columns in the table. <br />
Therefore, the entity classes are data classes that do not contain any logic.<br />

**DAO**
DAOs are interfaces annotated with @Dao, they provide methods that your app can use to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database.<br />

**Database**
The database class holds the database and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app’s persisted data. <br />
The database class provides your app with instances of the DAOs associated with that database. <br />
In turn, the app can use the DAOs to retrieve data from the database as instances of the associated data entity objects.<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bvhKqvqbNxlwInUnfju1cg.png)
Let’s walk through an example to understand the implementation.<br />

To get started with Room, add the following dependencies to your app’s build.gradle file:<br />

```
dependencies {
    def roomVersion = "2.3.0"
    implementation("androidx.room:room-runtime:$roomVersion")
    kapt "androidx.room:room-compiler:$roomVersion"
    implementation "androidx.room:room-ktx:$roomVersion"
    androidTestImplementation "androidx.room:room-       testing:$roomVersion"
    
 }

```
The following code snippet defines a Recipe model, which contains a list of Results, wherein the Result class contains each recipe’s properties.<br />
We will be persisting a list of recipes in the database.<br />

```
data class Recipe(
    @SerializedName("results")
    val results: List<Result>
)
data class Result(
    @SerializedName("sourceName")
    val sourceName: String,
    @SerializedName("sourceUrl")
    val sourceUrl: String,
    @SerializedName("summary")
    val summary: String,
    @SerializedName("title")
    val title: String,
    @SerializedName("vegan")
    val vegan: Boolean,
    @SerializedName("vegetarian")
    val vegetarian: Boolean,
    @SerializedName("veryHealthy")
    val veryHealthy: Boolean
)
  ```
Data Entity:<br />
```
@Entity(tableName = "recipes_table")
class RecipesEntity(
    var recipe: Recipe
) {

    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = false)
    var id: Int = 0

}
```
Our Entity class annotated with @Entity, has a name recipes_table. <br />
We will just have a single row of a list of recipes in the table, and so we do not need a primary key in this case and that is why I have set the autoGenerate property to false.

**Data Access Object (Dao):**

Our RecipesDao, annotated with @Dao, has two methods, one for inserting our recipes(RecipeEntity) in the table and the other for reading the cached recipes, which returns a flow of list of recipe entities.
```
@Dao
interface RecipesDao {

    @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE)
    suspend fun insertRecipes(recipesEntity: RecipesEntity)

    @Query("SELECT * FROM recipes_table ORDER BY id ASC")
    fun readRecipes(): Flow<List<RecipesEntity>>

}
```

Room by default can store primitive types only, to store custom objects we need to use TypeConverter to convert the custom objects into known database types.<br />
In our case, we will be converting our list of recipes into a string. The method which does the type conversion needs to be annotated with TypeConverter.<br />
```
class RecipesTypeConverter {

    val gson = Gson()

    @TypeConverter
    fun recipeToString(recipe: Recipe): String {
        return gson.toJson(recipe)
    }

    @TypeConverter
    fun stringToRecipe(recipeString: String): Recipe {
        val objectType = object : TypeToken<Recipe>() {}.type
        return gson.fromJson(recipeString, objectType)
    }

}
``
I have defined two methods, one to convert our Recipe object into a string, and the other to convert back the string to the Recipe object.<br />
I am using Gson for the type conversion.<br />

Database<br />
```
@Database(
    entities = [RecipesEntity::class],
    version = 1,
    exportSchema = true
)
@TypeConverters(RecipesTypeConverter::class)
abstract class RecipesDatabase : RoomDatabase() {

    abstract fun recipesDao(): RecipesDao

}
```
Our database class annotated with @Database, defines the database configuration and serves as the app’s main access point to the persisted data.<br />
In the database, we need to mention the list of entities, the database version if we want to export the database schema into a folder, and the type convertors if any.<br />

Usage:<br />

After we have defined the data entity, the DAO, and the database object, we can use the following code to create an instance of the database. I am using Hilt for DI.<br />
```
@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
object DatabaseModule {

    @Singleton
    @Provides
    fun provideDatabase(
        @ApplicationContext context: Context
    ) = Room.databaseBuilder(
        context,
        RecipesDatabase::class.java,
        RECIPES_DATABASE_NAME
    ).build()

    @Singleton
    @Provides
    fun provideDao(database: RecipesDatabase) =    database.recipesDao()

}
```
I have created a LocalDataSource class that will be exposing DAO’s methods to the repository. Here I am injecting the Dao class via constructor injection.<br />
```
class LocalDataSource @Inject constructor(
    private val recipesDao: RecipesDao
) {

    suspend fun insertRecipes(recipesEntity: RecipesEntity) {
        recipesDao.insertRecipes(recipesEntity)
    }

    fun readRecipes(): Flow<List<RecipesEntity>> {
        return recipesDao.readRecipes()
    }
}
```
Now in the repository, I will be injecting the Remote data source. I have used @ActivityRetainedScoped so that our repository survives configuration changes.<br />
```
@ActivityRetainedScoped
class Repository @Inject constructor(
    localDataSource: LocalDataSource
) {
    val local = localDataSource
}
```

You can similarly inject your remote data in the repository and then use it in the ViewModel classes.<br />

```
@HiltViewModel
class MainViewModel @Inject
constructor(
    private val repository: Repository,
    application: Application,
) :
    AndroidViewModel(application) {

    /**ROOM DATABASE*/

    val readRecipes: LiveData<List<RecipesEntity>> = repository.local.readRecipes().asLiveData()

    private fun insertRecipes(recipesEntity: RecipesEntity) {
        viewModelScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
            repository.local.insertRecipes(recipesEntity)
        }
    }

    private fun cacheRecipes(recipe: Recipe) {                        // saving recipe as a Recipe Entity object, and inserting in the db.
        val recipesEntity = RecipesEntity(recipe)
        insertRecipes(recipesEntity)
    }
    // Other logic 
}

```

Here I am reading data from the injected repository and storing it in the readRecipes variable as Live Data.<br />
I call cacheRecipes(recipe: Recipe) on a successful API response.<br />

Finally, I am accessing the recipes in my fragment, and setting the data to the adapter,<br />
```
private fun readCachedData() {
    lifecycleScope.launch {
        mainViewModel.readRecipes.observeOnce(viewLifecycleOwner) { dataBase ->
            if (dataBase.isNotEmpty()) {
                Log.d(TAG, "readCachedData:() ")
               
              recipesAdapter.submitList(dataBase[0].recipe.results)
            } else {                                               // in case database is empty
                requestApiData()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Our data in the database will look like this,<br />

## Define relationships between objects 
The relationship between objects defines how these objects will interact or collaborate to perform an operation in an application.<br /> 
In any application, objects of user interface classes interact with the business layer objects in order to perform an operation.<br />

## Accessing data with Room
So, let's get started.<br />

In previous articles, we have covered how we can use Room persistence library to create a relational database very easily. <br />
Some of the advantages of using Room are compile-time query verification, no boilerplate code and easy integration with RxJava, LiveData and Kotlin Coroutines.<br />
All these advantages in Room are achieved using Data Access Objects or DAOs.<br />

In this article, we going to discuss Data Access Objects or DAOs in detail.<br />

In Room, Data Access Objects or DAOs are used to access your application’s persisted data.<br />
They are a better and modular way to access your database as compared to query builders or direct queries.<br />

A DAO can be either an interface or an abstract class.
If it’s an abstract class, it can optionally have a constructor that takes a RoomDatabase as its only parameter.<br />
Room creates each DAO implementation at compile time.<br />

You can perform multiple operations using DAO like Insertion, Updation, Deletion and making raw queries.
Also, you can easily integrate LiveData, RxJava Observables, Kotlin Coroutines in DAOs.<br /><br />

Insertion<br />
When you create a DAO method and annotate it with @Insert, Room generates an implementation that inserts all parameters into the database in a single transaction.<br />

```
@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE)
    fun insertUsers(vararg users: User)    @Insert
    fun insertBothUsers(user1: User, user2: User)    @Insert
    fun insertUsersAndFriends(user: User, friends: List<User>)
}
```
onConflict annotation parameter signifies what to do if a conflict happens on insertion. It can take the following values:<br />

OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE : To replace the old data and continue the transaction.<br />
OnConflictStrategy.ROLLBACK : To rollback the transaction.<br />
OnConflictStrategy.ABORT : To abort the transaction. The transaction is rolled back.<br />
OnConflictStrategy.FAIL : To fail the transaction. The transaction is rolled back.<br />
OnConflictStrategy.NONE : To ignore the conflict.<br />
Note: ROLLBACK and FAIL strategies are deprecated. Use ABORT instead.<br />
Updation<br />
When you create a DAO method and annotate it with @Update, Room generates an implementation that modifies a set of entities, given as parameters, in the database.<br />
  It uses a query that matches against the primary key of each entity.<br />
```
@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Update(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE)
    fun updateUsers(vararg users: User)    @Update
    fun update(user: User)
}

```
Deletion<br />
When you create a DAO method and annotate it with @Delete, Room generates an implementation that removes a set of entities, given as parameters, from the database. <br />
  It uses the primary keys to find the entities to delete.<br />

@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Delete
    fun deleteUsers(vararg users: User)
}
Simple queries<br />
@Query is the main annotation used in DAO classes. It allows you to perform read/write operations on a database. <br />
  Each @Query method is verified at compile time, so if there is a problem with the query, a compilation error occurs instead of a runtime failure.<br />

Room also verifies the return value of the query such that if the name of the field in the returned object doesn’t match the corresponding column names in the query response, Room alerts you in one of the following two ways:<br />

It gives a warning if only some field names match.<br />
It gives an error if no field names match.<br />
  ```
@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM users")
    fun loadAllUsers(): Array<User>
}
  ```
Passing parameters into the query<br />

Parameters passed to the DAO methods can be used into the query written in @Query annotation.<br />
```
@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN :minAge AND :maxAge")
    fun loadAllUsersBetweenAges(minAge: Int, maxAge: Int): Array<User>

    @Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name LIKE :search " +
           "OR last_name LIKE :search")
    fun findUserWithName(search: String): List<User>
}
  ```
Returning subsets of columns<br />

You can also return subsets of columns from a query in Room.<br />
```
data class NameTuple(
    @ColumnInfo(name = "first_name") val firstName: String?,
    @ColumnInfo(name = "last_name") val lastName: String?
)@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Query("SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users")
    fun loadFullName(): List<NameTuple>
}
  ```
Direct cursor access<br />
<br />
If your app’s logic requires direct access to the return rows, you can return a Cursor object from your queries.<br />
```
@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM users")
    fun loadAllUsers(): Cursor
}
  ```
Querying multiple tables<br />

Some of your queries might require access to multiple tables to calculate the result. <br />
  Room allows you to write any query, so you can also join tables. <br />
  Furthermore, if the response is an observable data type, such as Flowable or LiveData, Room watches all tables referenced in the query for invalidation.<br />
```
@Dao
interface BookDao {
    @Query(
        "SELECT * FROM book " +
        "INNER JOIN loan ON loan.book_id = book.id " +
        "INNER JOIN user ON user.id = loan.user_id " +
        "WHERE users.name LIKE :userName"
    )
    fun findBooksBorrowedByNameSync(userName: String): List<Book>
}
```
Query return types<br />
Room supports a variety of return types for query methods, including specialised return types for interoperability with specific frameworks or APIs.<br />
  
  
  ![](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mindorks-server-uploads/data-access-objects-dao-in-room-query-return-type-54d650c9a15ce49e.png)
  You can return LiveData, Observable and Flow from query methods. Also, you can make a DAO method suspend function. These are discussed in separate articles.<br />
