## What Does Stack Mean?
A stack is a conceptual structure consisting of a set of homogeneous elements and is based on the principle of last in first out (LIFO).<br />
It is a commonly used abstract data type with two major operations, namely push and pop. Push and pop are carried out on the topmost element, which is the item most recently added to the stack. <br />
The push operation adds an element to the stack while the pop operation removes an element from the top position. <br />
The stack concept is used in programming and memory organization in computers.<br />
A stack is considered to be a restricted data structure as only a limited number of operations are allowed.<br />
Besides the push and pop operations, certain implementations may allow for advanced operations such as:<br />

1.Peek — View the topmost item in the stack.<br />
2.Duplicate — Copy the top item’s value into a variable and push it back into the stack.<br />
3.Swap — Swap the two topmost items in the stack.<br />
4.Rotate — Move the topmost elements in the stack as specified by a number or move in a rotating fashion.<br />
we have two  concepts use it stack:
LIFO<br />
This is known as Last-In-First-Out approach or LIFO.<br />
Where is LIFO used:<br />
 

Data Structures – <br />
Certain data structures like Stacks and other variants of Stacks use LIFO approach for processing data.<br />
 <br />
Extracting latest information – <br />
Sometimes computers use LIFO when data is extracted from an array or data buffer. When it is required to get the most recent information entered, the LIFO approach is used. <br />

FILO<br />
Stands for "First In, Last Out." FILO is an acronym used in computer science to describe the order in which objects are accessed.<br />
It is synonymous with LIFO (which is more commonly used) and may also be called LCFS or "last come, first served."<br />
